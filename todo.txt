CODING
- how to display (start with terminal), move to web?
- use api to build dataset
- train model on dataset to predict best heros while drafting (decision tree -> neural network?)
    - figure out how to test if the model is doing a good job (k folds)
    
DOTA
- maybe recommend multiple heros (in case teammates cant play best hero)
- maybe separate by cluster (region) (maybe query only certain regions)
- discount games with abandons
- separate by mmr bracket (dont query low mmr brackets)
- grab all games with a start time after (or a week after) the first patch
- only query certain game modes (captains mode and maybe all pick)

- look into match_id retrieval
    - are they sequential?
    - get only desired match_ids (e.g. captains mode, US East/West, > 4000 mmr avg)
    
- look into player specific recommendations based on player history


IN PREDICTIONS FILE:
- get SQL call to query all games where hero picks match the current state. Then return the next pick with the highest win rate
- use bandit algorithm to strengthen our predictions on the games we play using the application
